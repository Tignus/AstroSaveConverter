    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>This project aims to help Astroneer players switching from Microsoft XBOX save format to Steam save format. Astroneer can be played either on Steam or on XBOX Gamepass and both have different ways to store save files. Steam games are saved in one file, no matter the size of the save, while XBOX won't go over 16MB files, splitting the saves into several chunks if they get too big.</p>
